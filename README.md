## Aims and Motivation
- The aim of this project was to create a relational database which helps Kumon and its instructors to easily view and manage records on existing and new customers.
- When I began working at the tuition centre, the centre was ran by senior people who stored customer information on pen and paper. As demand grew, it was visually clear that they were finding it difficult to manage customer information. This is where I stepped in and proposed the idea of creating a relational database (which they are now using to easily manage their customer information) and coaching them on how to use the database.
- I created common queries which were later turned into views for the database allowing everyone, no matter their skillset and experience with using databases or computers to be able to easily use the database.
