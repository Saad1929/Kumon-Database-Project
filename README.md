## üéØAims and Motivation
- The objective of this project was to **develop a relational database** that facilitates Kumon and its instructors in **efficiently accessing and overseeing records of both existing and new customers**.
- Upon commencing my tenure at the tuition center, it became evident that the management, predominantly consisting of senior individuals, relied on manual record-keeping using pen and paper for customer information. As the demand for our services surged, it became apparent that they were grappling with the arduous task of effectively managing customer data. Recognising this challenge, **I took the initiative to introduce and implement the concept of a relational database**, enabling seamless management of customer information. Furthermore, I **provided comprehensive coaching sessions to familiarize the staff with the database, ensuring its smooth utilization and maximizing its benefits for the center**.
- I **developed a set of standard queries that were subsequently transformed into views for the database**, enabling individuals of varying skill sets and computer proficiency to **effortlessly utilize the database**.
## ‚öôÔ∏èHardware and Software Tools
- **MySQLWorkbench** was used to create the database, tables and add records using **SQL**.
- **DataGrip** was used for **writing queries and creating database views** to store results to important queries.
- **Lucidchart** was used to create **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagrams** for clients to **view and visualise** their database. These diagrams were also used as **part of comprehensive coaching provided to clinets**.
- **Git** was used as a **Version Control System (VCS)** to maintain a history of the software project.
- **GitHub** was used to host and share code repositories with clients as agreed in the **release & sprint planning meetings.**
## ‚úèÔ∏èDesign
### Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram
- An **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram** was created to provide a **clear and intuitive visual representation of the structure and relationships within the database** which was used in **sprint & release planning meetings**.
