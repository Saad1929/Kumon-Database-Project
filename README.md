## Aims and Motivation
- The aim of this project was to create a relational database which helps Kumon and its instructors to easily view and manage records on existing and new customers.
- Upon commencing my tenure at the tuition center, it became evident that the management, predominantly consisting of senior individuals, relied on manual record-keeping using pen and paper for customer information. As the demand for our services surged, it became apparent that they were grappling with the arduous task of effectively managing customer data. Recognising this challenge, I took the initiative to introduce and implement the concept of a relational database, enabling seamless management of customer information. Furthermore, I provided comprehensive coaching sessions to familiarize the staff with the database, ensuring its smooth utilization and maximizing its benefits for the center.
- I created common queries which were later turned into views for the database allowing everyone, no matter their skillset and experience with using databases or computers to be able to easily use the database.
